# XtendSearch

Extensible Robust Enterprise Search Server

## Getting Started

1. You need to install JDK 8 to build and run this project.
2. Docker is used for packaging the application into a distributable image. (optional) 

While it is completely possible to work on this project without any sophisticated
pre-requisites to work with the code, it is recommended to use an IDE supporting
Gradle (such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA). It will make your life easier.

* [Instructions for Eclipse](http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html#import-an-existing-gradle-project)

You can also use other code editors like Visual Studio Code or Atom, albeit with
a little more manual effort.

### Running the project

From the command line, run:
```
./gradlew bootRun
```

Else, use your IDE to start the project. The server will be available at
http://localhost:8080/
